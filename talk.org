* TOC

- What is Kakfa
- Why Kafka
- Kafka and Clojure
- Demo time
- Real world scenario

** Kafka

- distributed *append only immutable* log
- extremely scalable (constant time)
- >250k SLOC (Java/Scala)
- Zookeeper for distribution
- open sourced by LinkedIn in 2011
- just recently released 1.0

** Components

- Publisher API
- Consumer API
- Stream API
- Connector API

** Log anatomy

This is an example of how partitions look like, so each partition is
simply an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually
appended to.

Each record has assigned an offset in the form of a sequential id,
that it's used to reference to it univocally.

An important thing to keep in mind is that Kafka will store all your
records forever, but it will enforce a retention period, which is the
number of days something is available to be consumed. This allows to
have constant time performances independently by the amount of total
data currently stored.

** Log consumer

** Streaming

* Why Kafka

- Scalability
- Data integrity
- Auditing
- Proper Microservices

** Data dichotomy

[[./images/dicothomy.png]]

* Clojure

- *Functional* Lisp
- *Immutable* by default
- *Data* centric
- *JVM* based (but also JS and CLR)
- Great *REPL* experience

* Demo Time

* Case study - Reconciliation
** Reconciler

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file graph.png :cmdline -T png :exports none :results silent
  digraph reconciler {
          r [label="repayments"];
          tr [label="transactions"];
          rec [label="Reconciles?", shape="diamond"];
          rec_r [label="Reconciled\nrepayments"];
          unrec_r [label="Unreconciled\nrepayments"];
          unrec_tr [label="Unreconciled\ntransactions"];

          r -> rec;
          tr -> rec;
          rec -> rec_r [label="Y"];
          rec -> unrec_r [label="N"];
          rec -> unrec_tr [label="N"];
   }

** Implementation

- ingest repayments topic
- ingest transactions topic
- repayments ⨝ transactions
- augment that with reconciled? information
- branch on reconciled? to various output topics

** Data flow (1)

Ingest input topics:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  ;; bank transactions
  {:id 1
   :amount-cents 100
   :value-date "2017-01-01"}

  {:id 2
   :amount-cents 150
   :value-date "2017-01-04"}

  ;; repayments
  {:id 1
   :amount-cents 100
   :effective-date "2017-01-01"}
#+END_SRC

** Data flow (2)

Left join and augment:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  ;; first payment reconciled
  {:transaction {:id 1
                 :amount-cents 100
                 :value-date "2017-01-01"}

   :repayment {:id 1
               :amount-cents 100
               :effective-date "2017-01-01"}

   :reconciled? true}
  ;; second repayment didn't reconcile
  {:transaction {:id 2
                 :amount-cents 150
                 :value-date "2017-01-04"}

   :repayment {:id 1
               :amount-cents 100
               :effective-date "2017-01-01"}

   :reconciled? false}
#+END_SRC

** Data flow (3)

Branch on reconciled:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  ;; bank transactions reconciled
  {:id 1
   :repayment-id 1
   :amount-cents 100
   :value-date "2017-01-01"}

  ;; repayments un-reconciled
  {:id 1
   :amount-cents 150
   :effective-date "2017-01-04"}
#+END_SRC

** Business logic (1)

Core business logic is just *pure functions*

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

  (defn dates-reconciles?
    [value-date effective-date]
    (and (not (t/before? value-date effective-date))
         (<= (t/in-days (t/interval effective-date value-date))
             reconciliation-window)))

  (defn reconciles?
    [bank-transaction repayment]
    (and (some? bank-transaction)
         (some? repayment)
         (= (:amount-cents bank-transaction) (:amount-cents repayment))
         (dates-reconciles? (tc/to-date-time (:value-date bank-transaction))
                            (tc/to-date-time (:effective-date repayment)))))

  ;; (reconciles?
  ;;  {:amount-cents 100 :value-date "2018-01-01"}
  ;;  {:amount-cents 100 :effective-date "2018-01-01"}) => true
#+END_SRC

** Business logic (2)

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

  (defn set-reconciled
    [repayment txn]
    {:bank-transaction txn
     :repayment        repayment
     :reconciled       (reconciles? txn repayment)})
